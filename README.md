## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Variables 
- CSS Media queries

### What I learned

I learnt how to use css variables, how to use focus for links, css animations and media quieries to have a responsive element.

```css
:root{
    --main-bg-color:hsl(47, 88%, 63%);
    --main-color:hsl(0, 0%, 7%);
    --small-font-size: 0.875rem;
    --border-radius: 1.25rem;
    --margin-bottom: 0.75rem;
}
```
```css
 .title:focus{
   color: var(--main-bg-color);
 }
```

### Continued development
my aim is to use css variables in more detail in my projects, it's quite complete and very effective as a way of writing css, as well as being comfortable with media querries and being able to work with animations.
